# Project Description
e-nom is an app that believes that  nourishment is for every one – it is your ultimate hydration companion with a mission to keep you hydrated and support marine biodiversity conservation.

In regions like the Philippines, where temperatures often surpass 40 degrees Celsius (currently 41 degrees), staying hydrated is vital for health. Existing hydration reminder solutions lack adaptability to extreme weather, leading to increased dehydration risks. Moreover, urgent environmental action is needed to preserve marine biodiversity. We require an innovative solution that seamlessly integrates hydration reminders into daily routines while supporting environmental conservation efforts, aligning with Sustainable Development Goals 3 and 14.

## Objective
Our objective is to simply beat the heat by quenching peoples’ thirst and keeping them hydrated during this high heat index season in the Philippines, while donating and preserving marine biodiversity by donating to organizations (like Philippines Biodiversity Conservation Foundation, Marine Wildlife Watch of the Philippines, etc.) while people are staying hydrated through our app's challenges and reminders. 

## Features

E-nom's key features include:

- **User Profile and Avatar Making**
- **Hydration Tracker** 
- **Weather Forecast** 
- **Heat Index Updates** 
- **Charitable Contribution** 

## Technical Stack

Our app's user interface (UI) was crafted using Figma, ensuring a visually appealing and intuitive design. 

## Future Plans

In the future, we aim to further develop and refine our app by dedicating more time to mastering Flutter techniques and integrating Firebase and APIs to their fullest potential. Due to time constraints, we were unable to fully realize our vision for the app's functionality and user experience.
